## 1.3. Course Work

A place for me to keep track of the Udemy WordPress Course work.

### 11/11/2023 Notes to Marcelo

As promised, here is a public repo so that you can view the code.

Honestly, since this is NOT a compile error, only a VSCode PHP Linting error, I think the problem is in the PHP Linter I am using. So I would ignore the current concern.

In other words, when I use the format in the video, instal my plugin, it works fine.  If I change the code to appease the PHP VSCode Linter, it also works.  This is not worth looking into.
